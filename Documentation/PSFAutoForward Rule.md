* _Please do not use the outlook application to setup the rule, because that relies on your laptop being left on and outlook open while you are on leave._

Click on that and a menu will pop out from the side of the screen, like this. 

Look down to the bottom of the sidebar. Under the section "Your app settings", there is a  'Mai' option. Click on that.

An options menu will pop out from the left hand side of the window - see below.

Under the section "Automatic processing", look for "inbox and sweep rules"

The resulting screen will look like this.

To create the rule, click on the '+' button to start creating a new rule.

Give the rule a name. I suggest you call it 'PSF autoforwarding rule'.

Now you need to set the conditions of the rule. 

Under 'When the message arrives, and it matches all of these conditions' select the following conditions

    'It includes these words -> in the sender's address'

When you select those conditions, a window like this will pop up.

Now add the first domain address of the client whose emails you want to foward in the top box. e.g. if it is Bain emails you wish to forward add '@bain.com'- See below for an example.

Click on the '+' button to add that address.

Repeat the above process until all client domains are added. *Please dont all client domains in one entry, as that does not work.*

once complete,press okay to exit that menu.

That will bring you back to the previous menu where you create the rule.

Under the section 'Do all of the following', select the following conditions

    'Forward, redirect, or send -> Forward the message to'

When you select those conditions, a new window will open where you need to search for the person you forwarding the client emails to. Find their email address and add it as a recipent email address.

Once complete, press Save.

Tick the option 'Stop processing more rules' and press okay.

The rule is now setup.

*Please remember to disable this rule until such time that you want to enable it*
